  /*
  Perhaps the most important sequence type to know about is class List, the immutable linked-list described in detail
  in the previous chapter. Lists support fast addition and removal of items to the beginning of the list, but they do
  not provide fast access to arbitrary indexes because the implementation must iterate through the list linearly.

  This combination of features might sound odd, but they hit a sweet spot that works well for many algorithms.
  The fast addition and removal of initial elements means that pattern matching works well. The immutability of lists
  helps you develop correct, efficient algorithms because you never need to make copies of a list.
