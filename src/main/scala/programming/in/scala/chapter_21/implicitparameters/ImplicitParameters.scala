/**
  * Created by denis.shuvalov on 15/04/2018.
  *
  * The remaining place the compiler inserts implicits is within argument lists. The compiler will sometimes replace
  * someCall(a) with someCall(a)(b), or new SomeClass(a) with new SomeClass(a)(b), thereby adding a missing parameter
  * list to complete a function call. It is the entire last curried parameter list that's supplied, not just the last
  * parameter. For example, if someCall's missing last parameter list takes three parameters, the compiler might replace
  * someCall(a) with someCall(a)(b, c, d). For this usage, not only must the inserted identifiers, such as b, c, and d
  * in (b, c, d), be marked implicit where they are defined, but also the last parameter list in someCall's or someClass's
  * definition must be marked implicit.

  //provide the prompt explicitly

  Greeter.greet("Bob")(bobsPrompt)
  //Welcome, Bob. The system is ready.
  //relax>

  //Once you bring it into scope via an import, however, it will be used to supply the missing parameter list:

  //To let the compiler supply the parameter implicitly, you must first define a variable of the expected type,
  //which in this case is PreferredPrompt.

    //Note that the val itself is marked implicit. If it wasn't, the compiler would not use it to supply the missing parameter list.

  import JoesPrefs._
  Greeter.greet("Joe")
  //Welcome, Joe. The system is ready.
  //Yes, master>
  Greeter.greetV2("Joe")
  //One thing to note about the previous examples is that we didn't use String as the type of prompt or drink, even
  //though ultimately it was a String that each of them provided through their preference fields. Because the compiler
  //selects implicit parameters by matching types of parameters against types of values in scope, implicit parameters
  //usually have "rare" or "special" enough types that accidental matches are unlikely. For example, the types
  //PreferredPrompt and PreferredDrink were defined solely to serve as implicit parameter types. As a result,
  //it is unlikely that implicit variables of these types will be in scope if they aren't intended to be used as
  //implicit parameters to Greeter.greet.

  //Ordering[T], provides more information about type Tâ€”in this case, how to order Ts. Type T is mentioned in List[T],
  //the type of parameter elements, which appears in the earlier parameter list. Because elements must always be provided
