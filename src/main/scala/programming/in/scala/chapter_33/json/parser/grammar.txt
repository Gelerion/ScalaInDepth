A JSON value is an object, array, string, number, or one of the three reserved words null, true, or false. A JSON object
is a (possibly empty) sequence of members separated by commas and enclosed in braces. Each member is a string/value pair
where the string and the value are separated by a colon. Finally, a JSON array is a sequence of values separated by
commas and enclosed in square brackets

Example:
   {
      "address book": {
        "name": "John Smith",
        "address": {
          "street": "10 Market Street",
          "city"  : "San Francisco, CA",
          "zip"   : 94111
        },
        "phone numbers": [
          "408 338-4238",
          "408 111-6892"
        ]
      }
    }
