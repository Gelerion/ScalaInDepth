Parser input

Sometimes, a parser reads a stream of tokens instead of a raw sequence of characters. A separate lexical analyzer is
then used to convert a stream of raw characters into a stream of tokens. The type of parser inputs is defined as follows:

  type Input = Reader[Elem]

The class Reader comes from the package scala.util.parsing.input. It is similar to a Stream, but also keeps track of
the positions of all the elements it reads. The type Elem represents individual input elements. It is an abstract type
member of the Parsers trait:

  type Elem

This means that subclasses and subtraits of Parsers need to instantiate class Elem to the type of input elements that
are being parsed. For instance, RegexParsers and JavaTokenParsers fix Elem to be equal to Char. But it would also be
possible to set Elem to some other type, such as the type of tokens returned from a separate lexer.
