value type
    A value type is any subclass of AnyVal, such as Int, Double, or Unit. This term has meaning at the level
    of Scala source code. At runtime, instances of value types that correspond to Java primitive types may be
    implemented in terms of primitive type values or instances of wrapper types, such as java.lang.Integer.
    Over the lifetime of a value type instance, the runtime may transform it back and forth between primitive
    and wrapper types (i.e., to box and unbox it).
